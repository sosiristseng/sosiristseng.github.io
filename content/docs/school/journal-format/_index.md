From the FAQs: <https://www.cell.com/iscience/faqs>

A publication fee of $3,000 (USD) is required to publish in iScience. (Oh my)

iScience ***does not*** require a particular format for articles at submissions.

### Figures

Figure guidelines: <https://www.cell.com/iscience/figureguidelines>

- 8.5" x 11" page
- *Avenir* font: https://fontspace.io/avenir-font/
- For initial submission, we prefer **TIFF** or **PDF** figure formats. As small as under 2 MB.
- Text should be about **7 pt** at the desired print size.
- Graphical abstract: <https://www.cell.com/pb/assets/raw/shared/figureguidelines/GA_guide.pdf>
- If you want to reprint or adapt images from published Cell Press or Elsevier articles, you do not need to ask our permission. Our policy only requires that you cite the original publication in the figure legend.

For newly submitted articles or revisions still under review, please keep figure files as small as possible (1–2 MB) so that editors and reviewers can more easily work with the files.
