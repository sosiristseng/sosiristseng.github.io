pipeview ([`pv`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pv-command-in-linux-with-examples/)) shows transfer speed and/or progress through a Unix pipe.

`pv` works like `cat`. For example,

```sh
cat file > other_file # no output with cat
pv file > other_file Â # With progress
```

```sh
# Showing both compression progress and speed
pv file | gzip > file.gz
# Sandwich form, showing speed without progress
cat file | pv | gzip > file.gz
```
