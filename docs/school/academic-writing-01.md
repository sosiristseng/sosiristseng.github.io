- Habits for productive writing : *15 minutes per day*
- Dirty tricks to publish more papers (e.g. choose the right journal and customize your paper for the editors)
- Deal with rejections and revive the failed paper.

> Treat your papers like products and editors like your customers. <cite> Steven Wallace </cite>

## The publication challenge

Only **11% acceptance rate** for average quality papers. i.e., 8 out of 9 are rejected.

Greatest causes leading to rejection for TW researchers are

- Poor English
- Unclear motivation
- Not useful, others could not benefit / extend from this study

## How to fix most English errors

- Redundency: too wordy
- Verb tense: past vs. present vs. future
- Too much passive voice: most journals prefer active voice nowadays

### Prefer active voice to passive voice

Because active voice is generally shorter, clearer, and more direct than passive voice.

If you don't want `I` and `we` show up too many times, you could use the `study` as the subject.

#### Situations for passive voice

- Subject **unknown** / **obvious** / **irrevalent**
- The `Method` section: since the subject is apparent (we)
- The object is more important than the subject

### Verb tense matters

- **past**: One study. *single* time point `Their study in 2000 showed that ...`
- **present perfect**: many studies (*multiple* time points) `Previous studies have indicated that ...`
- **present**: facts and implications
- **future**: not done, *do not* say that unless it is future work

### Prefer verbs to nouns and strong verbs to weak verbs

e.g. make an improvement => improve

- Eliminate weak token verbs (undergone, make, ...)
- Make the setence shorter and clearer

### Stop using pronouns

Pronouns like `It`, `they`, and solitary `this`, `that`... are unclear subjects and stress the mind of readers.

~~It is vital that S ...~~ -> `S must ...`

### Remember what you are comparing

AKA Apples to apples.

e.g. noun vs. noun, verb vs. verb, topic vs. topic

The device in this step has higher luminance **than previous models**.

### Verb agreement

Is the subject singular or plural? Look carefully.

### Avoid fuzzy words

They need more explanation and result in less clear sentences.

For the suggested substitudes, see the slides.

### Use precise words instead of general ones

You could look up [thesaurus](https://www.thesaurus.com/) or press `Shift` + `F7` in Microsoft Word to find words with similar meanings.

See the slides and the book for recommended replacements.


## Stay motivated and write 15 minutes per day

Sourced from most prolific writers.

### Establish a supply chain

- More than one steps for one paper
- More than one papers at a time (preferably 6-7 if you want publish once a year)
- Target your customer, choose the journal carfully and customize your papers to the journal's preference
- Write a 15-minute sprint per day.
- Not only screen time, but note / idea / script efforts matter.
- One and only one good idea per paper. No need to make a super-sized paper.
- Try different subtopics at the same time in case one direction fails.
- Learn from reviews and rejections, **fast** .
- Database for template sentences: copy, paste, and *revise* sentences. (And yes revision avoids plagiarism)
- Make others look at your papers. One could not edit his/her own papers.

### Sacrifice other interests

~~The most difficult part in my opinion.~~

> When you play, play hard; when you work, don't play at all. <cite> Theodore Roosevelt </cite>

Avoid distrations and notifications at all costs.

### Practice research writings

- Try to identify your weakness: words? grammar?
- Imitate skillful writers and thier model papers to form a checklist for your papers
  - Best with experience author with mediocre / failed results, meaning the writing is extraordinary.

### Mental models to dramatize success

Think "what you are going to get after writing".

Although writing is no fun and everyone detests writing.

~~Does not work for the pessimistic.~~
