[Artifacts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts) are data generated by workflows that can be passed to subsequent jobs.

## Workflows

### Official workflows

The https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact and the https://github.com/actions/download-artifact actions by GitHub for storing and retrieving artifact(s) in **the same workflow**.

### Artifacts across two different workflows

The https://github.com/dawidd6/action-download-artifact action downloads and extracts uploaded artifact(s) associated with a **given (different) workflow**.

### Link to artifacts in pull requests

The https://github.com/tonyhallett/artifacts-url-comments action creates comment(s) in pull request and/or associated issues containing the URL to artifacts from the workflow run being watched.

## Merge multiple artifacts

`merge-multiple: true`

```yaml
- name: Download notebooks
  uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  with:
    path: path/of/artifacts
    pattern: notebook-*
    merge-multiple: true
- name: Display structure of downloaded files
  run: ls -R path/of/artifacts
```
