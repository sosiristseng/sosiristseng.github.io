## Why go to conferences

To meet other humans of the same _special interest group_ and to impress them

- reviewers and editors
- potential coauthors

Show them you are interested in their studies. Exchanging email addresses is even better.

## Conference paper

- Accepts partial results (if you get full results go for regular journals)
- Most likely not count towards multiple submissions, except
  - Journal conference papers
  - Conference with a ISBN
- If rejected, send a nice letter to query reviewer comments to help your paper.

### Abstract
- Match the keyword for survive the screening and for search engines
- Word limit for abstract is around 300 words (2 sentences for each section)
- Do not use abbreviations. uncommon acronyms, symbols difficult to explain
- Cite one new research for novelty, one important person in your field, and one conference reviewer (e.g. technical editor) for connection.

## How to write a paper

(General version)

### Writing order

Methods and results -> (target a journal) -> Intro and discussion -> title

### Introduction

- Avoid telling a long history
- Minimal amount a necessary background information
  - Motivation
  - Literature review for terms and definitions
  - Knowledge gap
  - Research questions (Research aim)
- Only cite for
  - Context (motivation)
  - Keywords (lit. review)
  - Concepts (lit. review)
  - Knowledge gap (related work)
- Common mistakes ⚠️
  - Cite one source too much
  - Cite irrelevant sources
  - Overcite definitions
  - Misattribute (may upset your referee)
    - Misuse implication as facts
  - Cite a citation (for the keyword definition, go for the first one)
  - Quote too much
  - _Paraphrasing_ : when you just opy the notes. Instead: close the reference and note and try to recall by impression alone.

### Tenses
- Present: for facts and descriptions in figures / tables
- Present perfect: for multiple previous studies (e.g. knowledge gaps)
- Past: for a single previous study and your methods / results

### Materials and methods

- Past tense, except for populations and facts
- Cite for methodology only
- Passive voice to hide `we`
- Occasionally hint the reader the purpose of your methods
- Avoid using `then` too much
  - After A, B...
  - Once A, B ...
  - In the end, ...
- Verbs > Nouns. Adv. + Verb >> a lot of descriptions
- Give your devices a meaning name instead of tube 1, tube 2, ...

### Results

Figures and table are here to save your text, not to replicate them.
- Use present tense in the descriptions
- legends should be standalone
- Put related data into subplots
- Avoid power point humors

### Discussion

What does your results mean?

- Note and difference of strong vs weak verbs: e.g. found (strong facts) vs. suggested (weak implications)
- Do reverse lit. review to state the connection of prev. work and yours
- Future works to encourage other to join force and you can get cited. Also get relevant to the reality.
