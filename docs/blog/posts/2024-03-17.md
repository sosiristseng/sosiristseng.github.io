For example, find changed PHP files between latest and the commit before it: ([Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4734300/git-changed-file-names-with-certain-extension))

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD '**/*.php'
```

If the shell does not support the glob pattern, use `grep`

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD | grep .php
```
