After `zsh` is installed, run:

```sh
wget -nv -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zimfw/install/master/install.zsh | zsh
```

### Powerlevel10k (p10k) prompt

1. In `~/.zimrc`, replace `zmodule asciiship` with

```sh title="~/.zimrc"
zmodule romkatv/powerlevel10k --use degit
```

2. Run `zimfw install` in zsh to complete install.
3. Install [powerline fonts](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#manual) or [nerd fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) for icons.
4. Restart zsh and finish p10k's interactive configuration steps.

### Node version manager (nvm)

1. Add the following line in `~/.zimrc` to add Node version manager (nvm).

```sh title="~/.zimrc"
zmodule lukechilds/zsh-nvm
```

2. Run `zimfw install` in zsh to install nvm.
3. To save loading time of zsh, you can use lazy loading by adding the following line to the beginning of `~/.zshrc`:

```sh title="~/.zshrc"
export NVM_LAZY_LOAD=true
```
