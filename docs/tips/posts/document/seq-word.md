References => insert caption; creates an anchor for equations, figures, and tables.

References => Cross-reference to link text to the target.

## Use a sequence filed

The [Seq (Sequence) field](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/field-codes-seq-sequence-field-062a387b-dfc9-4ef8-8235-29ee113d59be) sequentially numbers chapters, tables, figures, and other items in a document.

To add a sequence field: Insert > Quick parts > Field > Select `SEQ` command.

Press `F9` to update a field. Press `Ctrl+ A` (select all) then `F9` to update all fields in the document.
