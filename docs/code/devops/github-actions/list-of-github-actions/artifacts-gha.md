[Artifacts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts) are data generated by workflows that can be passed to subsequent jobs.

## Official workflows

The [upload-artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) and the
[download-artifact](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact) actions by GitHub for storing and retrieving artifact(s) in **the same workflow**.

## Artifacts across two different workflows

The [action-download-artifact](https://github.com/dawidd6/action-download-artifact) action downloads and extracts uploaded artifact(s) associated with a **given (different) workflow**.

## Link to artifacts in pull requests

The [artifacts-url-comments](https://github.com/tonyhallett/artifacts-url-comments) action creates comment(s) in pull request and/or associated issues containing the URL to artifacts from the workflow run being watched.
